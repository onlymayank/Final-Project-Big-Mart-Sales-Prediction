# Big Mart Sales Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for my Data Science final project, focused on predicting sales for Big Mart outlets. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze historical sales data and build a predictive model for future sales.

## Problem Statement
Big Mart, a leading retail chain, is facing challenges in optimizing its sales across various outlets. The goal of this project is to develop a robust predictive model that can forecast the sales of different products at Big Mart outlets. This will aid in inventory management, stocking appropriate quantities, and ultimately maximizing revenue.

## Data
The project leverages a dataset provided by Big Mart, comprising historical sales data for different products across various outlets. The dataset includes information such as product attributes, outlet details, and sales figures.

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration:** Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of the dataset, identify patterns, and gain insights into the sales trends.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features as necessary.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the model's ability to capture patterns in the data.

4. **Model Development:** Implement machine learning models, such as linear regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods, to predict sales based on the features extracted from the dataset.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and fine-tune them to achieve the best results.

6. **Deployment:** Deploy the final model for predicting sales, making it ready for use in real-world scenarios.
